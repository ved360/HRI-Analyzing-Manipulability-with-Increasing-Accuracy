Analyzing Trial-Based Changes in Arm Manipulability and Accuracy During Spiral Drawing 

> **Problem Statement:**

Human motor performance improves with practice, reflecting changes in neuromuscular coordination and control. However, the biomechanical implications of such improvement, particularly in terms of arm manipulability during repetitive tasks, remain underexplored. Spiral drawing can serve as a tool to evaluate how joint configurations and kinematic properties evolve as a person learns to perform a task more accurately under time pressure. The primary problem addressed in this study is understanding how the manipulability of the human arm changes over repeated spiral-drawing trials and how these changes correlate with improvements in task accuracy.

> **Abstract:**

This project aims to investigate the relationship between motor learning and arm manipulability by analyzing how a subject's arm performance evolves over repeated trials of a constrained spiral drawing task. A subject will be asked to draw a spiral 20–30 times using only shoulder and elbow joint movements while the wrist is fixed. Each trial will be performed within a fixed duration (e.g., 5 seconds) to introduce a speed-accuracy tradeoff. The spatial deviation from an ideal spiral will be recorded as a measure of accuracy, while joint angles of the elbow and shoulder will be captured using encoders to analyze the arm's kinematic configuration. Using this data, the manipulability of the arm—quantified using the Jacobian matrix and its related metrics—will be computed for each trial. The study will explore how manipulability ellipses evolve across trials and whether improved accuracy corresponds with more favorable manipulability characteristics. This analysis can provide insights into motor adaptation, task-space coordination, and potential applications in rehabilitation and human-robot interaction design.
